By: `Team W11-2`      Since: `Jan 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command

// tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of the Item Interface (split into a separate diagarm for clarity)
image::ModelItemDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Restaurant Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Item>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// end::model[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::addfeature[]

=== Add Feature

The add feature allows the user to add items to the `RestaurantBook`.
It also populates the item added to the `RestaurantBook` with parameters supplied by the user.

==== Current Implementation

The add feature is implemented as four separate commands, one for adding each type of item: `addMember`, `addBooking`, `addIngredient`, `addStaff`.
Each command is implemented as a `AddCommand` class. For example, the `addMember` command is implemented as the `AddMember` class.
All `AddCommand` class inherit from the `Command` class.
As the general flow of the various add commands are similar, the `addMember` command will be used as an example here.
The `AddMemberCommand` class adds the member to the `RestaurantBook` by utilising the `MemberModel#addMember` method exposed by the `MemberModel` interface, which facilitates the interaction with the `VersionedRestaurantBook` to add the member via the `VersionedRestaurantBook#addItem` method.
The state of the `RestaurantBook` is then saved via the `Model#commitRestaurantBook` method exposed by the `Model` interface, which saves the `RestaurantBook` using the `VersionedRestaurantBook#commit` method.

For the `AddBooking` command, the list of bookings is sorted after the new booking is added to ensure that bookings are ordered by time.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect: Implementation of the four add commands**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: four separate add commands, one for each type of item
** Pros:
*** Easier implementation
** Cons:
*** Causes code duplication, as all the add commands differ only by their parameters, and function similarly otherwise.
*** More types of commands for the user to remember

* **Alternative 2**: a single add command, with a type field to indicate the type of item to be added
** Pros
*** Reduces the number of distinct commands in the RestaurantBook, thus making the `RestaurantBook` a simpler application for users.
** Cons
*** Complicates the add command as the parameters for the add command depend on the command type parameter passed into the command
*** May have to display a long usage guide comprising examples of adding all four types of items

* Decision: Alternative 1 was selected for the following reasons:
** A greater variety of add commands is more intuitive than a single complex command.
** Separating the add commands allows for greater versatility in customising the various add commands.

// end::addfeature[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::ds[]
=== Data structure for holding records

Following the AB4 structure, the `RestaurantBook` (originally `AddressBook`) class serves as the main database, holding information of all records in the system. However, the database system required is more complicated than the one in AB4- there are four different kinds of records that need to be stored. The main operations are still largely CRUD (create, read, update, delete) in nature which are very similarly done. However, there are some differences between the types of records:

* Some commands such as `addBooking` needs to keep track of the `Capacity` of the restaurant- we must not allow the restaurant to be overbooked. There is no equivalent of this in the `addMember`, `addIngredient` or `addStaff` commands.
* The `editMember` command requires all `Booking` associated to the `Member` to have an updated copy of all the `Member` details. Again, there is no equivalent of this in the other edit-style commands.

==== Current implementation

We created the interface `Item` to represent a record. A `UniqueItemList` was used to handle the bulk of the CRUD logic, much like the way the `UniquePersonList` in the original AB4 was used to handle the CRUD logic. As the `Staff` and `Member` class store common attributes (`Name`, `Phone`, `Email`), an abstract class `Person` was used to capture this. The relation between the types of `Item` is also captured in the class diagram of Figure 8. However, in the `Model` interface, the methods are kept separate (using methods like `addMember`, `addBooking` instead of having a more generic `addItem` method).

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of data structure
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the `Item` interface to capture the similarity between records.
** Pros: Reduces code duplication as we do not need separate classes `UniqueMemberList`, `UniqueBookingList`, `UniqueIngredientList`, `UniqueStaffList`.
** Cons: As the operations for different records are not exactly the same, RestaurantBook needs to be aware of the differences between the similar operations.

* **Alternative 2:** Create four separate classes which do not inherit from any parent class or interface.
** Pros: The precise CRUD operations can be heavily customised for each type of record.
** Cons: Lots of code duplication.

* Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted as the differences between the operations are relatively minor and can be done at the `RestaurantBook` level without creating too much confusion.

===== Aspect: Implementation of the model interface
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain separate methods for the similar-looking CRUD-style methods
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: More code duplication, the `Model` API now contains many methods.

* **Alternative 2:** Generalize the methods so that there is only one of them for each type of command (e.g. `addItem` instead of `addBooking`, `addMember`) in the Model API.
** Pros: Reduces the overall amount of code needed with less duplication. The `Model` API looks simpler on the surface with less methods.
** Cons: Violates Separation of Concerns principle, due to the differences across the similar-looking methods. Since the implementation of various `add` commands are slightly different (`addBooking` needs to check the restaurant capacity first), many if-else statements will be required in the control flow of `RestaurantBook#addItem` method, potentially using `instanceof` checks. These `instanceof` checks can potentially violate type safety.

* Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted as we value simplicity over the potential problems that might arise with the generic methods.
// end::ds[]

// tag::editcmd[]

=== The `editMember` command

When a `Member` details (`Name`, `Phone`, or `Email`) is changed, the `Booking` object must reflect the change. This requires an internal modification to the `Booking` list.

==== Current implementation

When `RestaurantBook#setMember()` is called, the bookings are replaced with a new set of bookings, in a way such that any `Booking` containing the modified member will be replaced with another `Booking` object that correctly reflects the modified customer.

(Insert sequence diagram)

==== Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Manually perform a corresponding change to the `Booking` list whenever the personal details of a member changes.
** Pros: Easier to implement as it does not require much change to the already-existing AB4 codebase.
** Cons: Poor efficiency. This involves scanning through the entire list of bookings just to change the personal details of a single `Member`. Also, if some other command changes a `Member` details without going through the `RestaurantBook#setMember()` method, the update will not be reflected.

* **Alternative 2:** Make the `Member` class mutable. Whenever the `Member` details changes, the `Booking` will automatically extract the correct details of the `Member` and nothing needs to be done.
** Pros: This eases the load on the `RestaurantBook` class and does not require special treatment. It is also more efficient as no additional work is done.
** Cons: The current `undo` and `redo` commands rely on the immutabilty of the `Member` class to work correctly. Doing so may require a huge change in implementation of `undo` and `redo` commands. Also, allowing mutable variables can potentially be a source of other bugs.

* **Alternative 3:** Assign each `Member` an ID and store the mapping from ID to `Member`. Instead of storing the full details of the `Member`, the `Booking` object simply stores the `ID` of the member that made the booking. When an update occurs, we simply need to update the ID to `Member` map.
** Pros: Provides both lookup efficiency as well as immutability of the `Member` objects.
** Cons: Uses additional data structure to store the mappings, potentially making the code more difficult to maintain.

* Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted as we felt that it was the simplest way to implement the feature. The additional efficiency gained may not even be significant, considering that in simple GUI apps like this, updating the UI is often the part of the program that uses the most resources. Optimizing the backend operations may not actually lead to a significant performance improvement.
// end::editcmd[]

// tag::delete[]
=== Delete Feature

The delete feature is used to delete a specific record in the restaurant book, i.e. deleting a member, staff, booking, ingredient or recipe.

In comparison to the original AB4 codebase, REstaurant Manager has more than 1 type of record in the restaurant book, and has a high level of dependency/ coupling between certain components:

* Between Member and Booking: a booking contains a specific member -  Booking is highly coupled to Member
* Between Ingredient and Recipe: a recipe contains ingredients – Recipe is highly coupled to Ingredient


Therefore, there are some design considerations that we have to make when it comes to deleting a record.


==== Current implementation
* There are separate delete commands for each of the 4 components, namely `deleteMember`, `deleteBooking`, `deleteStaff`, `deleteIngredient` and `deleteRecipe`, and the command explicitly specifies the object being deleted. Each specific delete command has a `DeleteCommand` class that extends abstract class `Command` and is supported by a `CommandParser` class (e.g. `deleteIngredient` command has `deleteIngredientCommand` class and `deleteIngredientCommandParser` class).

.Sequence Diagram for DeleteIngredient
image::DeleteIngredientSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


* The delete commands are called by typing the component-specific command, followed by an index, which refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing (e.g. `deleteIngredient 3`).

* When a member is deleted, all booking objects containing the deleted member must be similarly deleted.  Also, when an ingredient is deleted, all recipe objects containing the deleted ingredient must also be deleted.
In other words, when RestaurantBook#deleteMember() or RestaurantBook#deleteIngredient() is called, this triggers all related bookings or recipes to be deleted as well.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Separate delete commands/ Generic delete command
* ** Alternative 1 (current choice):** separate commands for each component, i.e. `deleteMember`, `deleteBooking`, `deleteStaff`, `deleteIngredient`, `deleteRecipe` to delete from respective lists.
*** Pros: Easier implementation
*** Cons:
** Leads to code duplication, as each delete command requires an additional `Command` and `CommandParser` class.
** Inconvenient for user to type out a longer command (e.g. `deleteIngredient` vs `delete`).

* ** Alternative 2:** one generic delete command, requiring the model to determine the active list (currently displayed list on the panel), and to delete from that particular list
*** Pros: Shorter commands required from user, (e.g. `delete` vs `deleteIngredient`).
*** Cons: Requires user to type in additional command prior to the `delete` command (e.g. list or filter command), to change the state of the intended list to active.

* Decision: Alternative 1 was selected for the following reasons:
*** Aliases are implemented as a shortcut to the long commands (e.g. `db` for `deleteBooking`, `dm` for `deleteMember`). It is no longer inconvenient for users as they can type the shorter command.
*** 4 panels are implemented in U/I (link to u/i segment), 1 panel for each component provides easy cross-reference across linked records, and this supports Alternative 1's implementation. All lists are active at the same time, and they display all unfiltered records by default. Firstly, it is hard for the user to detect an active list at first glance, since all lists are already displayed. Secondly, a specific delete command can be called without a prior command to mark the list as active (e.g.  `deleteIngredient` can be called directly to make changes to Ingredient list) which makes it more convenient for the user


===== Aspect: Deletion by index/ Deletion by field
* ** Alternative 1 (current choice):** delete records by index in the most recent listing.
*** Pros:
** Easier implementation as it does not require much change to the already-existing AB4 codebase.
** Standardized command format for all delete commands (e.g. `deleteIngredient INDEX` and `deleteBooking INDEX`).
** Index for a record is easily identified from its corresponding list.

*** Cons:
** Index may be incorrectly typed, especially if the list is too long or there are similar records in the list.
** Unfiltered list may be too long for user to scroll through to find the index. Methods are required to filter the list or find a specific record before `delete INDEX` command is called.

* ** Alternative 2:** delete records by field.
*** Pros: Greater certainty that the right record is deleted.
*** Cons:
** Variations in command format for each delete command. They may have different prefixes and fields that the user has to type in.
** Some records are identified by more than 1 field, and all necessary fields must be provided for successful deletion of a record, making the command longer and harder to type (e.g. `deleteBooking` command requires `bookingWindow` and `customerName` fields to be present to delete a record).

* Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted for greater standardisation across the 5 components (Member, Bookings, Ingredient, Recipe, and Staff).


===== Aspect: Highly coupled records
* ** Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deleting a member will result in the deletion of all bookings done by this member. Similarly, deleting an ingredient will result in the deletion of all recipes using this ingredient.
*** Pros: Easier to implement

*** Cons: There is a possibility that the user accidentally deletes a record (e.g. member), and all other records (e.g. bookings made by this member) referencing this record is also accidentally deleted.

* ** Alternative 2:** Only records that are not referenced can be deleted. (e.g. During an attempt to delete a member that has made a booking, an error message is displayed to prompt the user that this member is referenced in the booking list. The user is required to manually delete all bookings done by this member before he is allowed to delete the member).
*** Pros: Reduces the possibility that the user accidentally deletes a record (e.g. member), and all other records (e.g. bookings made by this member) referencing this record is also accidentally deleted.
*** Cons: Inconvenient for the user to manually remove all referencing records before he can delete the referenced record.

* Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted as it is an easier implementation and it makes it more convenient for the user to delete a record. It is intuitive that if a deleteMember or deleteIngredient command is called and these objects cease to exist in the restaurant book, the corresponding Booking or Recipe containing these objects should also cease to exist. To deal with the possibility that the member or ingredient is accidentally deleted, and all referenced bookings and recipes is unintentionally deleted, an additional field in the delete command can be added as a confirmation that these records should be deleted.

// end::delete[]

// tag::shifts[]

=== Shifts feature

The shifts feature allows users to maintain shift rosters for staff members, as well as

==== Current Implementation

The shifts feature comprises of two main commands: the `addshift` command and the `deleteshift` command.
The `addshift` command allows shifts to be added to the shift roster of a staff member, and the `deleteshift` command allows shifts to be deleted from the shift roster of a staff member.
The shifts feature is supported by two models, the `Shift` model and the `ShiftRoster` model. The `Shift` model represents a single shift that takes place during a single interval of time, while the `ShiftRoster` model stores an immutable, sorted list of shifts for a single staff member.
The following seqeuence diagram shows how the `addshift` command works.

image::AddShiftSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of the shift roster

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store a weekly shift roster for each staff member, which stores a list of sorted shifts.
** Pros:
*** Enables the possibility of storing shifts for staff members who work multiple shifts.
** Cons:
*** Must ensure that there are no clashes between any two shifts in a single shift roster.

* **Alternative 2:** Each staff member can only have one shift over a single interval of time.
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement.
** Cons:
*** Impossible to represent all the shifts for staff members that work for more than one shift.

** Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted as it provides greater versatility, and it is likely for a single staff member to work different shifts on multiple days in a week.

===== Aspect: Implementation of the time range of shifts

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Represent weekly shifts by storing the start day and time as well as the end day and time in a date range, where the start day and end day are different.
** Pros:
*** Enables to possibility of storing shifts across multiple days.
*** Greater certainty as to exactly when a shift starts and ends.
*** Allows validation checks by ensuring that shifts are of positive duration.
** Cons:
*** Tedious to check if two shifts clash in the shift roster.

* **Alternative 2:** Represent weekly shifts by storing only the start day, start time and end time. If the end time is before the start time, then it is assumed that the shift ends on the next day.
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement.
*** Easy to check if two shifts clash in the shift roster.
** Cons:
*** Impossible to provide validation checks as there are no invalid shifts.
*** Implicit assumption that the shift ends on the following day if the end time is earlier than the start time may be confusing for users.

** Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted as it allows shifts to be more flexible, and provides greater certainty for the time intervals of the shifts.

===== Aspect: Implementation of the `deleteShift` command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Requiring the user to specify the exact start day and time as well as the end day and time of the shift to be deleted.
** Pros:
*** Provides greater certainty for the shift that is to be deleted as shifts are not indexed.
*** Requiring the user to key in the exact shift to be deleted acts as a form of confirmation for the deletion.
** Cons:
*** Causes the command to be long winded and hard to type.

* ** Alternative 2:** Requiring the user to specify the index of the shift to be deleted.
** Pros:
*** Reduces the number of parameters in the `deleteShift` command, thus making the command easier to type.
** Cons:
*** As the shifts are not indexed, the user may delete the incorrect shift by mistake.

* Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted as it is more reliable and provides certainty for which shift is to be deleted.

// end::shifts[]

// tag::stats[]
=== The `statsdays` command

When the `statsdays` command is entered, the current statistis of the amount of bookings is to be displayed to the user in the form of a bar chart.

==== Current implementation

When the user enters the `statsdays` command, `RestaurantBookParser` calls the `Statistics` class. The Statistics class fetches the relevant data for user display (ie what are the axes, values, and legends of the bar chart). It would then call the `StatsWindow` class which handles the UI. The bar chart will appear in a new window and does not affect the current window.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of data structure

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Doing the calculation only when the user wants to view the statistics.
** Pros: Calculating only when needed is more efficient.
** Cons: The command would take some time to calculate before being able to display the statistics.

* **Alternative 2:** Every change to the database updates the statistics on the fly.
** Pros: Displaying the statistics on the UI would be faster.
** Cons: Need to change the implementation of every command that causes a change to the database. Calculations have to be done every operation, potentially affecting the efficiency of the `add` or `delete` commands.

* Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted as the other commands do not need to be changed and it is easier to implement. As the number of times the `stats` command is called is likely to be low as compared to an `add` or `delete` operation, doing the calculation after every operation would be a waste of computation power.

===== Aspect: Design of UI display

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displaying the statistics in a new window.
** Pros: The statistics would be displayed independently from the database and would not interfere with each other.
** Cons: The user can open multiple windows which contains different data and not know which is the correct window.

* **Alternative 2:** Hide the displayed database to show the statistics. A separate command would be used to toggle the view.
** Pros: There would be only 1 window to manage at any point in time.
** Cons: Cannot view the statistics and the database concurrently.

* Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted as it is an easier implementation. Implementing the `stats` window as a static window that will not change would not affect the other parts of the app, and there is no need to hide and show the current screen. Moreover, the user might want to view the statistics together with the database, which is only possible with multiple windows.

// end::stats[]

// tag::panelui[]
=== The panel UI for `Member`, `Staff`, `Booking`, and `Ingredient`

The restaurant book displays the entire database in the form of "cards", which is the same as AB4. Each item has its own panel.

==== Current implementation

The panel is formatted in the `ItemListPanel.fxml` file, and each item has its own controller (`MemberListPanel`, `StaffListPanel`, `BookingListPanel`, and `IngredientListPanel`) that extends from `ItemListPanel`. The panel displays the database via cards. Each item has its own card (`MemberCard`, `StaffCard`, `BookingCard`, and `IngredientCard`).

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Design of card display

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Making a separate fxml file for each type of item card.
** Pros: Able to customise the card to suit the item.
** Cons: Need to duplicate common elements that all the cards share, such as the numbering on the list.

* **Alternative 2:** Using the same fxml file for each item card.
** Pros: Less duplication.
** Cons: Hard to customise the contents of each card.

* Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted as each card do not share much in common other than the numbering on the list. Each card needs to display different information. For example, the `Member` item would need to display the email, while the `Ingredient` item would need to display other fields such as the quantity. Hence, not much code is duplicated, and creating 4 files would be the easiest implementation.

===== Aspect: Design of panel display

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using the same fxml file for each item panel.
** Pros: Less duplication.
** Cons: Hard to customise the contents of each panel.

* **Alternative 2:** Making a separate fxml file for each item panel
** Pros: Able to customise the panel to suit the item.
** Cons: Need to duplicate common elements that all the item panels share.

* Decision: Alternative 1 was adopted. Currently, the only difference between the panels is the header (implemented via a `label`) which contains the name of the item type. This only affects a single label, which is easy to edit via code. Hence, sharing the fxml file reduces the code duplication. If the display of the panels were to be modified in the future, say to add more padding or to change the size, only one fxml file needs to be modified.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
