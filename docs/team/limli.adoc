== PROJECT: REstaurant Manager

---

== Overview

REstaurant Manager (REM) is a desktop application that turns your restaurant into a smart restaurant. It is meant for restaurant owners to manage their member base, staff, bookings and food inventory.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *statistics feature*
** What it does: allows the user to view statistics of the history of bookings made.
** Justification: When the restaurant wants to analyze trends so as to make decisions such as when to hire more staff, it is beneficial to view the statistics so that they can make a more informed decision.
** Highlights: This feature requires the familiarity of the javafx library, as the statistics would be displayed using the `Chart` in javafx, which has a steep learning curve.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Implemented the UI for the staffs, bookings, ingredients, and recipes.
** Implemented loyalty points for members
