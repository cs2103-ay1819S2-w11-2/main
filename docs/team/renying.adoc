== PROJECT: REstaurant Manager

---

== Overview
This portfolio summarises my contributions made throughout the project.

REstaurant Manager (REM) is a desktop application tailored to restaurant owners of small/medium size restaurants.
This application provides a single platform for them to manage many areas of the restaurant:
customers with membership, staff, bookings, ingredient and recipe inventory.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *ingredient and recipe feature*
** What it does: allows the user to add, restock and consume ingredients, keeping track of the quantity of ingredient remaining in the inventory. Ingredients with quantity in inventory falling below the user-inputted warning amount can also be listed.
 User can also add recipes, keeping track of the ingredients, and its required quantity in each recipe.
** Justification:
This feature improves the product significantly, as the recipe and ingredient features help to keep track of dishes served in the restaurant and inventory status for the ingredients. This can enable the users to make decisions, such as to restock ingredients, or limit number of bookings, to ensure smooth running of restaurant.
