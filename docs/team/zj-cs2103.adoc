== PROJECT: REstaurant Manager

This portfolio serves to document my contribution to _REstaurant Manager_, an undergraduate level software engineering project for the module CS2103T - Software Engineering. _REstaurant Manager_ was developed over a course of 6 weeks by a team of 4 members. It is written in Java and is based on an existing code base, https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[Address Book (Level 4)].

== Overview

_REstaurant Manager_ (REM) is an application that provides a four-in-one package for restaurant owners to easily manage various aspects of their restaurant.
It allows restaurant managers to manage their member base, reservations, menu, inventory as well as manpower.

Visit our https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819S2-w11-2/main[project] on github to try out our application.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *staff feature*
** What it does: It acts as a simple manpower management system for restaurant managers. It allows users to add, remove, edit and list staff working in a restaurant. Users can also manage the shift rosters of the staff members.
** Justification: Restaurant managers need to be able to manage the staff that are working in the restaurant. It is also important for restaurant managers to know when each staff is on shift in the restaurant. With this feature, restaurant managers will be able to easily manage their staff, so that appropriate manpower and hiring decision can be made to keep the restaurant running smoothly.
** Highlights: To provide flexibility in managing the shift rosters of the staff, the ability to add both weekly shifts that span across multiple days, weekly shifts that span across a short, well-defined period of time as well as weekly overnight shifts was implemented. Shifts that clash must also be prevented. As a result, careful handling of time ranges and intensive testing of the logic was required to ensure that the feature works correctly.
