== Introduction

REstaurant Manager (REM) is for small/medium size restaurant owners who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their restaurant*. More importantly, REM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, REM can get your restaurant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

As REM is targeted at _restaurant owners_, it aims to facilitate the management of a restaurant, in these 5 different areas:

* Member Management
    ** Manage the contact details of the customers with membership
* Inventory Management
    ** Manage the inventory of recipes and stocks of inventory
* Booking Management
    ** Manage the reservations made by the general public
* Staff management
    ** Manage the contact details of the staff, and facilitate their shift work allocation
* Overall
    ** Collation of feedback by customers, and general statistics of the performance of the restaurant

This user guide is designed to provide assistance to Restaurant Managers who utilise REM.

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Features
====
*Command Format*

* Commands begin with the intended task, followed by a number of parameters preceded by a key (a unique alphabet and forward slash). The intended task (`addMember`) is non case-sensitive in the program and can be typed quickly as `addmember`, but is written in this manner for the user guide to be easily read.
    ** e.g. `addMember n/CUSTOMER_NAME e/EMAIL p/PHONE_NUMBER`.
* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
    ** e.g. `addMember n/CUSTOMER_NAME e/EMAIL p/PHONE_NUMBER [l/LOYALTY_POINTS]`
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times
    ** e.g. `addRecipe r/RECIPE_NAME iq/INGREDIENT_INDEX&INGREDIENT_QUANTITY__IN_RECIPE ...`
* Parameters can be in any order
====
*Date and Time Format*

* All parameters labelled as DATE_TIME should follow the yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm format, (e.g. `2019-02-23T13:00` means 23 Feb 2019, 1300 hrs). yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:SS format is also accepted.
* For the exact specification of what date and time formats are allowed, please refer to the `LocalDateTime` class in Java.
* Time without dates are also accepted. In that situation, `HH:mm` (e.g. `13:00`) format should be used and the date is automatically chosen to be the current date at the point of command execution.
