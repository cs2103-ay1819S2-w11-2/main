== Introduction

REM is for small/medium size restaurant owners who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their restaurant*. More importantly, REM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, REM can get your restaurant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

As REM is targeted at _restaurant owners_, it aims to facilitate the management of a restaurant, in these 5 different areas:

* Member Management
    ** Manage the contact details of the customers with membership
* Inventory Management
    ** Manage the inventory of recipes and stocks of inventory
* Booking Management
    ** Manage the reservations made by the general public
* Staff management
    ** Manage the contact details of the staff, and facilitate their shift work allocation
* Overall
    ** Collation of feedback by customers, and general statistics of the performance of the restaurant

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
    ** e.g. `notifySMS [l/LOYALTY_POINTS_MINIMUM]`
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times
    ** e.g. `addRecipe r/RECIPE_NAME n/NUMBER_OF_INGREDIENTS 1/INGREDIENT_1&AMOUNT_IN_UNITS 2/INGREDIENT_2&AMOUNT_IN_UNITS ...`
