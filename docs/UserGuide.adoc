== Introduction

REstaurant Manager (REM) is for small/medium size restaurant owners who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their restaurant*. More importantly, REM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, REM can get your restaurant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

As REM is targeted at _restaurant owners_, it aims to facilitate the management of a restaurant, in these 5 different areas:

* Member Management
    ** Manage the contact details of the customers with membership
* Inventory Management
    ** Manage the inventory of recipes and stocks of inventory
* Booking Management
    ** Manage the reservations made by the general public
* Staff management
    ** Manage the contact details of the staff, and facilitate their shift work allocation
* Overall
    ** Collation of feedback by customers, and general statistics of the performance of the restaurant

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Commands begin with the intended task, followed by a number of parameters preceded by a key (a unique alphabet and forward slash). The intended task (`addMember`) is non case-sensitive in the program and can be typed quickly as `addmember`, but is written in this manner for the user guide to be easily read.
    ** e.g. `addMember n/CUSTOMER_NAME e/EMAIL p/PHONE_NUMBER`.
* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
    ** e.g. `notifySMS [l/LOYALTY_POINTS_MINIMUM]`
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times
    ** e.g. `addRecipe r/RECIPE_NAME n/NUMBER_OF_INGREDIENTS 1/INGREDIENT_1&AMOUNT_IN_UNITS 2/INGREDIENT_2&AMOUNT_IN_UNITS ...`
* Parameters can be in any order
====
*Date and Time Format*

* All parameters labelled as DATE_TIME should follow the yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm format, (e.g. `2019-02-23T13:00` means 23 Feb 2019, 1300 hrs). yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:SS format is also accepted.
* For the exact specification of what date and time formats are allowed, please refer to the `LocalDateTime` class in Java.
* Time without dates are also accepted. In that situation, `HH:mm` (e.g. `13:00`) format should be used and the date is automatically chosen to be the current date at the point of command execution.
